# UFOs
## Overview
Dana built a webpage titled "The Truth is Out There which contains a table with a long list of UFO sightings. She wanted to add additional filters to her webpage in addition to the date filter that already exists so that users could easily find the data that they need instead of having to scroll through the entire table.
## Results 
### Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.
If someone wants to apply a filter to this table, they simply need to fill out the input box exactly with what they want to filter on and either press enter on their keyboards or click out of the input box. If they want to filter on multiple categories, they just need to fill out the input box for the other category. There is no button that needs to be pressed to apply these filters.

If someone wanted to filter on all UFO sightings with the circle share, they would have to type circle into the "shape" input box and press enter to see this output:
