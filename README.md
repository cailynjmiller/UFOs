# UFOs
## Overview
Dana built a webpage titled "The Truth is Out There which contains a table with a long list of UFO sightings. She wanted to add additional filters to her webpage in addition to the date filter that already exists so that users could easily find the data that they need instead of having to scroll through the entire table.
## Results 
### Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.
If someone wants to apply a filter to this table, they simply need to fill out the input box exactly with what they want to filter on and either press enter on their keyboards or click out of the input box. If they want to filter on multiple categories, they just need to fill out the input box for the other category. There is no button that needs to be pressed to apply these filters.

If someone wanted to filter on all UFO sightings in Arizona, they would type az into the "state" input box and press enter to see this output:
![az filter](https://github.com/cailynjmiller/UFOs/blob/main/az_filter.png)

If someone wanted to then filter on all UFO sightings with the rectangle shape as well as arizona, they would have to type circle into the "shape" input box and press enter to see this output:
![rectangle filter](https://github.com/cailynjmiller/UFOs/blob/main/rectangle_filter.png)

## Summary
### In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
One drawback to this design is the free text input boxes for the filters. This can lead to confusion if people mispell what they are searching for or want to search for as well as not being able to select multiple from each category or using a range for the date field.<br/>
The two recommendations I have with further development are:
- For the city, state, country, and shape filters make the filter a dropdown list in which you can select multiple values. This will make it so you can only select from relevant values and you can select multiple.
- Make the date filter a range so you can view any UFO sightings before and after certain dates. This will allow for someone who wants to filter on date to view more than one days worth of data.
